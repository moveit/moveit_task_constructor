/** PickPlaceBase wraps the pipeline to pick or place an object with a given end effector.
 *
 * Picking consist of the following sub stages:
 * - linearly approaching the object along an approach direction/twist
 * - "grasp" end effector posture
 * - attach object
 * - lift along along a given direction/twist
 *
 * Placing consist of the inverse order of stages:
 * - place down along a given direction
 * - detach the object
 * - linearly retract end effector
 *
 * The end effector postures corresponding to pre-grasp and grasp as well as
 * the end effector's Cartesian pose needs to be provided by an external grasp stage.
