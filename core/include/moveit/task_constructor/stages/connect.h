 * The states may differ in various planning groups.
 * To connect both states, the planners provided for individual sub groups are applied in the
 * specified order. Each planner only plan for joints within the corresponding planning group.
 * Finally, an attempt is made to merge the sub trajectories of individual planning results.
 * If this fails, the sequential planning result is returned.
