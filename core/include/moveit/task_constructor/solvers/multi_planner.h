/** A meta planner that runs multiple alternative planners in sequence and returns the first found solution.
 *
 * This is useful to sequence different planning strategies of increasing complexity,
 * e.g. Cartesian or joint-space interpolation first, then OMPL, ...
 * This is (slightly) different from the Fallbacks container, as the MultiPlanner directly applies its planners to each
 * individual planning job. In contrast, the Fallbacks container first runs the active child to exhaustion before
 * switching to the next child, which possibly applies a different planning strategy.
