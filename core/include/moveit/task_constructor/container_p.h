 * The container forwards states received in its pull interfaces to the
 * corresponding interfaces of the children.
 * States pushed by children are temporarily stored in pending_backward_ and pending_forward_.
 *
 * Solutions found by the children need to be lifted from the internal level to the
 * external level. To this end, we remember the mapping from internal to external states.

 * Note, that there might be many solutions connecting a single start-end pair.
