.. _Propagating Stages:

##################
Propagating Stages
##################

| Propagators receive solutions from one neighbor state, solve a problem and then propagate the result to the neighbor on the opposite side.
| Depending on the implementation, this stage can pass solutions forward, backward or in both directions.


MTC provides the following propagating stages:

* ModifyPlanning

* MoveRelative

* MoveTo

* FixCollisionObjects

ModifyPlanningScene
-------------------

| The ModifyPlanningScene stage applies modifications to the PlanningScene without moving the robot.
| By default, this stage propagates results in both direction.
| The default cost term is a constant of 0.

The stage contains function to
* Enable and disable collision checking between links
* Attach and detach objects to robot links
* Spawn and remove objects from scene

Example code to attach object

.. code-block:: c++

  auto stage = std::make_unique<stages::ModifyPlanningScene>("attach object");
  stage->attachObject("object_name", "gripper_frame_name");

Example code to enable collision

.. code-block:: c++

  auto stage = std::make_unique<stages::ModifyPlanningScene>("Allow collision between object and gripper");
  stage->allowCollisions("object_name", "gripper_frame_name", true);

MoveRelative
------------

| The MoveRelative stage is used to perform a cartesian motion.
| By default, this stage propagates results in both directions.
| The default planning time for this stage is 1.0s.
| The default cost term depends on path length.

  const auto cartesian_planner = std::make_shared<moveit::task_constructor::solvers::CartesianPath>();
  auto approach_pose =
      std::make_unique<moveit::task_constructor::stages::MoveRelative>("Approach", cartesian_planner);
  // Propagate the solution backward only
  stage_approach_grasp->restrictDirection(moveit::task_constructor::stages::MoveRelative::BACKWARD);
  stage_approach_grasp->setGroup("manipulator");
  stage_approach_grasp->setIKFrame("tool_frame");

  // Move the end effector by 0.15m in the z direction.
