# MoveIt Task Constructor Framework

The Task Constructor framework provides a flexible and transparent way to define and plan actions that consist of multiple interdependent subtasks.
It draws on the planning capabilities of [MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/) to solve individual subproblems in black-box *planning stages*.
A common interface, based on MoveIt's PlanningScene is used to pass solution hypotheses between stages.
The framework enables the hierarchical organization of basic stages using *containers*, allowing for sequential as well as parallel compositions.

## Tutorial

We provide a tutorial for a pick-and-place pipeline without bells & whistles [as part of the MoveIt tutorials](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/moveit_task_constructor/moveit_task_constructor_tutorial.html).

## Roadmap

**Feedback, reports and contributions are very welcome.**

The current roadmap is to replace MoveIt's old pick&place pipeline and provide a *transparent mechanism* to enable and debug complex motion sequences.

Further planned features include

- Entwined planning and execution for early execution, monitoring and code hooks
- Subsolution blending
- Parallel planning
- Iterative solution improvement

Ideas and requests for other interesting/useful features are welcome.
